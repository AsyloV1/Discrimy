# Discrimy

The purpose of this tool is to farm a account's discriminator until it hits one on a list that you can edit. In order to use this tool, you will need to put your user token and password in config.ini and have Python 3.5 or above and Pip installed. If you want to edit the list that Discrimy will stop farming at, edit discrimlist.ini.

If you are having issues with how GitHub handle text, you can download my pre-compressed version here: https://github.com/Gamerhythm/Discrimy/releases/tag/Discrimy
