# Discrimy

The purpose of this tool is to farm a account's discriminator until it hits one on a list that you can edit. In order to use this tool, you will need to put your user token, password and change any of the other settings in config.ini if needed and have Python 3.5 or above and Pip installed.

DISCLAIMER: This tool could be seen as a violation of the Discord TOS. Please use at your own risk. I have not ran on my main user account.
